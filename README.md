## Documentation
Really you just need tou use to functions

> mensajea_por_whatsapp_direct("contact's name", "message", iterations)

or instead of
>mensajea_por_whatssapp("contact's name", "File with your message on .txt", iterations)

#### Ready for coding!!



### Attention maybe you'll need to install

1. Selenium packages
